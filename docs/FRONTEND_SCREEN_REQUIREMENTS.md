# Pixie Girl Hub — Frontend Screen Requirements

**Audience:** Frontend engineering team building the React PWA admin + Next.js storefront.
**Companion to:** `ADMIN_UI_REQUIREMENTS.md` (backend CRUD tables).
**Stack:** React PWA (admin), Next.js (storefront), Tailwind, Socket.io, shadcn/ui (recommended)

This document tells the frontend team **what screens to build, where they live in the navigation, and how users interact with them.** The backend doc tells you _what tables CRUD_; this doc tells you _what the user sees and clicks_.

## Guiding principles

1. **Brand-switcher is global.** The top-bar brand selector toggles every screen between PXG and FLH context. All API calls auto-include the active brand. Cross-brand views (inter-company, AI insights cross-brand briefings) live on a third "Group" view.
2. **Permission-aware rendering.** Every screen reads the user's permission matrix on mount. Buttons disable, sections hide, menus collapse based on what the user is allowed to do. Never render an action a user can't perform.
3. **Mobile-first for staff screens.** POS, clock-in, stylist assignments, expense submissions, service job updates — all mobile-first PWA. Manager dashboards and pricing engine can be desktop-first.
4. **Real-time everywhere it matters.** Socket.io rooms for: stock levels, POS sessions, deliveries, service jobs, AI pending actions, dashboard widgets, sales campaign metrics, AI usage meter.
5. **Workflows are transparent.** Anywhere an action triggers a `workflow_definition`, the UI shows the chain: "→ Manager → CEO (if > ₦200k)" _before_ submission, then progress after.
6. **Draft/publish is universal.** Storefront themes, pages, navigation, email templates, sales campaigns, price proposals — all have a draft state with preview, then explicit publish.

## CROSS-CUTTING UI PATTERNS

### A. Brand-switcher behaviour

- Visible top-bar dropdown showing current brand
- Switching emits a global event; all screens re-fetch
- Cross-brand screens (Group view) explicitly opt-in; clearly marked

### B. Permission gating

- Use a `<RequirePermission module="..." action="...">` wrapper
- Disabled buttons show tooltip explaining missing permission
- Sidebar items hide entirely if user has zero permissions on that module

### C. Workflow surfacing

- Any action behind a workflow shows the chain _before_ submitting
- After submission, an inline progress strip shows current stage + ETA
- "My Approvals" badge in top bar with count

### D. Draft / publish pattern

Used in: Storefront themes/pages/nav, email templates, sales campaigns, price proposals, expense submissions, journal entries, PO submissions, payroll runs.

Components:

- Status badge: Draft (grey) / Pending Review (yellow) / Approved (blue) / Published or Posted (green)
- "Publish" / "Submit for approval" / "Post" buttons gated by status
- Audit strip: who created, who approved, when
- Edit becomes disabled in terminal states

### E. State machine visualisation

Used in: sales orders, POs, deliveries, production runs, service jobs, IC transactions, supplier invoices.

Components:

- Horizontal stepper showing all states
- Current state highlighted with timestamp
- Hover for state-transition history
- "Advance state" button (workflow-gated)

### F. Multi-currency display

- Customer-facing: show in their preferred currency with subtle "≈₦X" tooltip
- Admin-facing: show NGN as primary, original currency as secondary
- All input fields tagged with current currency
- FX rate used always visible on financial documents

### G. Real-time elements (Socket.io rooms)

| Subscription                           | Updates                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `brand:{brand}:stock`                  | Stock level changes across all screens showing inventory |
| `brand:{brand}:deliveries`             | Delivery state changes for ops dashboards                |
| `brand:{brand}:service_jobs`           | Service job status for FLH stylist board                 |
| `brand:{brand}:pos_session:{id}`       | Live POS transaction stream during a session             |
| `brand:{brand}:campaign:{id}`          | Sales campaign metrics during live state                 |
| `user:{id}:notifications`              | Per-user notification bell                               |
| `user:{id}:ai_pending`                 | Pending action push to Praxis panel                      |
| `system:ai_usage_meter`                | Live AI spend ticker in top bar                          |
| `brand:{brand}:order_timeline:{token}` | Customer tracking page live updates                      |

### H. Search (Cmd-K)

Global search across:

- Contacts (name, phone, email, NIN)
- Orders (number, customer)
- Products (name, SKU)
- Documents (number, type)
- Stylists
- Suppliers
- "Recent screens" history per user

### I. Bulk operations

Patterns common to list screens:

- Checkbox column with "select all on page" + "select all matching filters"
- Floating action bar appears with: export, bulk edit, bulk delete (if permitted), bulk assign, bulk apply tag

### J. Empty states

Every list/dashboard needs an empty state showing:

- Illustration or icon
- "No X yet" caption
- Primary CTA to create the first one
- Secondary link to docs / Praxis chat for help

### K. Loading + error states

- Skeleton loaders for tables and dashboards
- Toast notifications for errors with retry where possible
- Network-offline banner (PWA capability) — POS especially

### L. Mobile-specific screens

The following are mobile-first (the rest are desktop-first):

- POS (all screens)
- Clock-in
- Stylist task list
- Expense submission with OCR
- Service job status update (stylist)
- Praxis voice
- Order tracking (customer-facing)
- Storefront checkout

### M. Storefront-specific UI

Beyond admin, the customer-facing Next.js storefront needs:

- SEO-friendly product pages (meta tags from `product_seo`)
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for products
- Responsive image rendering from `product_images.responsive_paths`
- Theme tokens injected from `storefront_themes.tokens` at build / runtime
- Page templates rendering `storefront_pages.slots` JSONB
- Live cart sync with `shared.carts` table
- Customer account portal (Module 6.23 self-service)

### N. Cancellation timer (V2.2 §6.4)

On the order detail screen, when within the free-cancellation window:

- Live countdown timer (HH:MM:SS until `free_cancel_until`)
- Big "Cancel within free window" button
- Past the window: cancel button shows the fee that will be deducted

### O. Anti-pocketing alert (V2.2 §6.30)

On the Service Jobs dashboard, a sentinel widget:

- "N completed service jobs with no matching sale" — drill-down list
- Auto-refreshed when the AI insight runs

## DESIGN TOKENS & THEMING

Per `shared.storefront_themes.tokens`, the storefront supports per-brand colours, typography, etc. The **admin app** itself stays consistent across brands (otherwise CEO toggling between brands would be visually jarring). Suggested admin tokens:

| Token   | Value                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| primary | A neutral but warm brand colour (suggest: indigo or charcoal) |
| accent  | Brand colour chosen by CEO                                    |
| success | Green                                                         |
| warning | Amber                                                         |
| danger  | Red                                                           |
| muted   | Slate gray                                                    |

The brand context indicator (badge near top-bar brand switcher) is the ONE place admin UI tints to the current brand colour.

## OPEN QUESTIONS / DESIGN DECISIONS NEEDED

These warrant a conversation with the CEO/owner before implementation:

1. **Storefront templates** — V2 spec says "fixed Next.js templates with content slots, not full CMS." What's the initial set? Suggest: home_hero_v1, about_simple, contact_card, lookbook_grid, returns_policy.

2. **Brand colour palette for FLH** — needs confirmation. PXG presumably has an existing palette.

3. **Praxis personality** — formal, friendly, neutral? Affects all generated copy in briefings, drafts, voice responses.

4. **Mobile vs desktop for managers** — managers approve expenses, leave, payroll. Are they always at a desk? If they're field-mobile, all approval queues need solid mobile UX.

5. **Stylist app** — separate PWA bundle, or part of the main admin app with role-restricted view? V2 spec suggests stylist credentials are a separate JWT class; consider separate app.

6. **Customer reviews moderation** — moderation queue UX. Auto-approve verified-purchase reviews, hold others for manual review?

7. **Storefront localisation** — supports 6 currencies; does it also need language switching (English-only for V1)?

8. **POS hardware** — receipt printer integration via what API? Bluetooth thermal printer is standard but app needs the bridge.

9. **Customer-facing tracking page design** — the public `/track/{token}` page is the customer's first sense of the brand post-purchase. Needs design love.

10. **Praxis interruption** — when Praxis proposes a write, does the pending-action card block the user or just notify? Recommend: notify (toast + Praxis panel update), don't block.

## SUMMARY

The frontend team has roughly **~120 distinct screens to build**, organised across 31 modules. The patterns above (brand-switcher, permission gating, workflow surfacing, draft/publish, state-machine stepper, real-time updates) recur enough that a strong shared-components library will save weeks.

The backend `ADMIN_UI_REQUIREMENTS.md` document is the contract: every Tier-1 table needs a CRUD screen, every Tier-2 table needs an editable but seeded screen, every Tier-3 table needs a read/action-only screen. This document tells you _which screens those translate to_ and _what user interactions they support_.

Build the shared components first; the screens come quickly after.
